# Enable client\-side LDAPS using AD Connector<a name="ad_connector_ldap_client_side"></a>

Client\-side LDAPS support in AD Connector encrypts communications between Microsoft Active Directory \(AD\) and AWS applications\. Examples of such applications include WorkSpaces, AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\), Amazon QuickSight, and Amazon Chime\. This encryption helps you to better protect your organizationâ€™s identity data and meet your security requirements\.
