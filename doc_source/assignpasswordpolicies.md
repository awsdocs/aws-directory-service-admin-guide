# Assign password policies to your users<a name="assignpasswordpolicies"></a>

User accounts that are a member of the **AWS Delegated Fine Grained Password Policy Administrators** security group can use the following procedure to assign policies to users and security groups\.

**To assign password policies to your users**

1. Launch [Active Directory administrative center \(ADAC\)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd560651.aspx) from any managed EC2 instance that you joined to your AWS Managed Microsoft AD domain\.

1. Switch to the **Tree View** and navigate to **System\\Password Settings Container**\.

1. Double click on the fine\-grained policy you want to edit\. Click **Add** to edit the policy properties, and add users or security groups to the policy\. For more information about the default fine\-grained policies provided with AWS Managed Microsoft AD, see [AWS pre\-defined password policies](supportedpolicysettings.md#supportedpwdpolicies)\.

1. To verify the password policy has been applied, run the following PowerShell command:

   ```
   [Get\-ADUserResultantPasswordPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/addsadministration/get-aduserresultantpasswordpolicy?view=win10-ps) -Identity 'username'
   ```

If you do not configure any of the five password policies in your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory, Active Directory uses the default domain group policy\.
