## Create a Windows Server 2019 EC2 instance<a name="createkeypair1"></a>

Use the following procedure to create a Windows Server 2019 member server in Amazon EC2\. 

**To create a Windows Server 2019 EC2 instance**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the Amazon EC2 console, choose **Launch Instance**\.

1. On the **Step 1** page, locate **Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Base \- ami\-*xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx*** in the list\. Then choose **Select**\.

1. On the **Step 2** page, select **t2\.large**, and then choose **Next: Configure Instance Details**\.

1. On the **Step 3** page, do the following:
   + For **Network**, select **vpc\-*xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx* AWS\-DS\-VPC01** \(which you previously set up in the [Base tutorial](microsoftadbasestep1.md#createvpc)\)\.
   + For **Subnet**, select **subnet\-*xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx* \| AWS\-OnPrem\-VPC01\-Subnet01 \| AWS\-OnPrem\-VPC01**\.
   + For **Auto\-assign Public IP** list, choose **Enable** \(if the subnet setting is not set to **Enable** by default\)\.
   + Leave the rest of the settings at their defaults\.
   + Choose **Next: Add Storage**\.

1. On the **Step 4** page, leave the default settings, and then choose **Next: Add Tags**\.

1. On the **Step 5** page, choose **Add Tag**\. Under **Key** type **example\.local\-DC01**, and then choose **Next: Configure Security Group**\.

1. On the **Step 6** page, choose **Select an existing security group**, select **AWS DS RDP Security Group** \(which you previously set up in the [Base tutorial](microsoftadbasestep1.md#createsecuritygroup)\), and then choose **Review and Launch** to review your instance\.

1. On the **Step 7** page, review the page, and then choose **Launch**\.

1. On the **Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair** dialog box, do the following:
   + Choose **Choose an existing key pair**\.
   + Under **Select a key pair**, choose **AWS\-DS\-KP** \(which you previously set up in the [Base tutorial](microsoftadbasestep1.md#createkeypair2)\)\.
   + Select the **I acknowledge\.\.\.** check box\.
   + Choose **Launch Instances**\.

1. Choose **View Instances** to return to the Amazon EC2 console and view the status of the deployment\.

## Promote your server to a domain controller<a name="promoteserver"></a>

Before you can create trusts, you must build and deploy the first domain controller for a new forest\. During this process you configure a new Active Directory forest, install DNS, and set this server to use the local DNS server for name resolution\. You must reboot the server at the end of this procedure\.

**Note**  
If you want to create a domain controller in AWS that replicates with your on\-premises network, you would first manually join the EC2 instance to your on\-premises domain\. After that you can promote the server to a domain controller\.

**To promote your server to a domain controller**

1. In the Amazon EC2 console, choose **Instances**, select the instance you just created, and then choose **Connect**\. 

1. In the **Connect To Your Instance** dialog box, choose **Download Remote Desktop File**\. 

1. In the **Windows Security** dialog box, type your local administrator credentials for the Windows Server computer to login \(for example, **administrator**\)\. If you do not yet have the local administrator password, go back to the Amazon EC2 console, right\-click on the instance, and choose **Get Windows Password**\. Navigate to your `AWS DS KP.pem` file or your personal `.pem` key, and then choose **Decrypt Password**\.

1. From the **Start** menu, choose **Server Manager**\.

1. In the **Dashboard**, choose **Add Roles and Features**\.

1. In the **Add Roles and Features Wizard**, choose **Next**\. 

1. On the **Select installation type** page, choose **Role\-based or feature\-based installation**, and then choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Select destination server** page, make sure that the local server is selected, and then choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Select server roles** page, select **Active Directory Domain Services**\. In the **Add Roles and Features Wizard** dialog box, verify that the **Include management tools \(if applicable\)** check box is selected\. Choose **Add Features**, and then choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Select features** page, choose **Next**\. 

1. On the **Active Directory Domain Services** page, choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Confirm installation selections** page, choose **Install**\.

1. Once the Active Directory binaries are installed, choose **Close**\.

1. When Server Manager opens, look for a flag at the top next to the word **Manage**\. When this flag turns yellow, the server is ready to be promoted\. 

1. Choose the yellow flag, and then choose **Promote this server to a domain controller**\.

1. On the **Deployment Configuration** page, choose **Add a new forest**\. In **Root domain name**, type **example\.local**, and then choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Domain Controller Options** page, do the following:
   + In both **Forest functional level** and **Domain functional level**, choose **Windows Server 2019**\.
   + Under **Specify domain controller capabilities**, verify that both **Domain Name System \(DNS\) server** and **Global Catalog \(GC\)** are selected\.
   + Type and then confirm a Directory Services Restore Mode \(DSRM\) password\. Then choose **Next**\.

1. On the **DNS Options** page, ignore the warning about delegation and choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Additional options** page, make sure that **EXAMPLE** is listed as the NetBios domain name\.

1. On the **Paths** page, leave the defaults, and then choose **Next**\.

1. On **Review Options** page, choose **Next**\. The server now checks to make sure all the prerequisites for the domain controller are satisfied\. You may see some warnings displayed, but you can safely ignore them\. 

1. Choose **Install**\. Once the installation is complete, the server reboots and then becomes a functional domain controller\.

## Configure your VPC<a name="configurevpc1"></a>

The following three procedures guide you through the steps to configure your VPC for connectivity with AWS\.

**To configure your VPC outbound rules**

1. In the AWS Directory Service console, make a note of the AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory ID for corp\.example\.com that you previously created in the [Base tutorial](microsoftadbasestep2.md)\.

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Security Groups**\.

1. Search for your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory ID\. In the search results, select the item with the description **AWS created security group for d\-*xxxxxx* directory controllers**\.
**Note**  
This security group was automatically created when you initially created your directory\.

1. Choose the **Outbound Rules** tab under that security group\. Choose **Edit**, choose **Add another rule**, and then add the following values:
   + For **Type**, choose **All Traffic**\.
   + For **Destination**, type **0\.0\.0\.0/0**\.
   + Leave the rest of the settings at their defaults\.
   + Select **Save**\.

**To verify kerberos preauthentication is enabled**

1. On the **example\.local** domain controller, open **Server Manager**\.

1. On the **Tools** menu, choose **Active Directory Users and Computers**\.

1. Navigate to the **Users** directory, right\-click on any user and select **Properties**, and then choose the **Account** tab\. In the **Account options** list, scroll down and ensure that **Do not require Kerberos preauthentication** is **not** selected\.

1. Perform the same steps for the **corp\.example\.com** domain from the **corp\.example\.com\-mgmt **instance\.

**To configure DNS conditional forwarders**
**Note**  
A conditional forwarder is a DNS server on a network that is used to forward DNS queries according to the DNS domain name in the query\. For example, a DNS server can be configured to forward all the queries it receives for names ending with widgets\.example\.com to the IP address of a specific DNS server or to the IP addresses of multiple DNS servers\.

1. First you must get some information about your AWS Managed Microsoft AD\.

   Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Directory Service console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/directoryservicev2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/directoryservicev2/)\.

   

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Directories**\.

1. Select the **directory ID** of your AWS Managed Microsoft AD\.

1. Take note of the fully qualified domain name \(FQDN\), **corp\.example\.com**, and the DNS addresses of your directory\.

1. Now, return to your **example\.local** domain controller, and then open **Server Manager**\.

1. On the **Tools** menu, choose **DNS**\.

1. In the console tree, expand the DNS server of the domain for which you are setting up the trust, and navigate to **Conditional Forwarders**\.

1. Right\-click **Conditional Forwarders**, and then choose **New Conditional Forwarder**\.

1. In DNS domain, type **corp\.example\.com**\.

1. Under **IP addresses of the master servers**, choose **<Click here to add \.\.\.>**, type the first DNS address of your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory \(which you made note of in the previous procedure\), and then press **Enter**\. Do the same for the second DNS address\. After typing the DNS addresses, you might get a "timeout" or "unable to resolve" error\. You can generally ignore these errors\.

1. Select the **Store this conditional forwarder in Active Directory, and replicate as follows** check box\. In the drop\-down menu, choose **All DNS servers in this Forest**, and then choose **OK**\.
