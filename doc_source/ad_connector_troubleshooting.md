# Troubleshooting AD Connector<a name="ad_connector_troubleshooting"></a>

The following can help you troubleshoot some common issues you might encounter when creating or using your directory\.

Here are some common problems with AD Connector\.

## Seamless domain join for EC2 instances stopped working<a name="seamless_stops"></a>

If seamless domain join for EC2 instances was working and then stopped while the AD Connector was active, the credentials for your AD Connector service account may have expired\. Expired credentials can prevent AD Connector from creating computer objects in your Active Directory\. 

To resolve this issue, update the service account passwords in the following order so that the passwords match:

1. Update the password for the service account in your Active Directory

1. Update the password for the service account in your AD Connector in AWS Directory Service

Updating the password only in AWS Directory Service does NOT push the password change to your existing on\-premises Active Directory so it is important to do it in the order shown\.

## I receive a “Unable to Authenticate” error when using AWS applications to search for users or groups<a name="fails_when_searching"></a>

You may experience errors when searching for users while using AWS applications, such as WorkSpaces or Amazon QuickSight, even while the AD Connector status was active\. Expired credentials can prevent AD Connector from completing queries on objects in your Active Directory\. Update the password for the service account using the ordered steps provided above\.

## I receive a "DNS unavailable" error when I try to connect to my on\-premises directory<a name="dns_unavailable"></a>

You receive an error message similar to the following when connecting to your on\-premises directory:

```
DNS unavailable (TCP port 53) for IP: <DNS IP address>
```

AD Connector must be able to communicate with your on\-premises DNS servers via TCP and UDP over port 53\. Verify that your security groups and on\-premises firewalls allow TCP and UDP communication over this port\. For more information, see [AD Connector prerequisites](prereq_connector.md)\.

## I receive a "Connectivity issues detected" error when I try to connect to my on\-premises directory<a name="connectivity_issues_detected"></a>

You receive an error message similar to the following when connecting to your on\-premises directory:

```
Connectivity issues detected: LDAP unavailable (TCP port 389) for IP: <IP address>
Kerberos/authentication unavailable (TCP port 88) for IP: <IP address>
Please ensure that the listed ports are available and retry the operation.
```

AD Connector must be able to communicate with your on\-premises domain controllers via TCP and UDP over the following ports\. Verify that your security groups and on\-premises firewalls allow TCP and UDP communication over these ports\. For more information, see [AD Connector prerequisites](prereq_connector.md)\.
+ 88 \(Kerberos\)
+ 389 \(LDAP\)

## I receive an "SRV record" error when I try to connect to my on\-premises directory<a name="srv_record_not_found"></a>

You receive an error message similar to one or more of the following when connecting to your on\-premises directory:

```
SRV record for LDAP does not exist for IP: <DNS IP address>

SRV record for Kerberos does not exist for IP: <DNS IP address>
```

AD Connector needs to obtain the `_ldap._tcp.<DnsDomainName>` and `_kerberos._tcp.<DnsDomainName>` SRV records when connecting to your directory\. You will get this error if the service cannot obtain these records from the DNS servers that you specified when connecting to your directory\. For more information about these SRV records, see [SRV record requirements](prereq_connector.md#srv_records)\.

## My directory is stuck in the "Requested" state<a name="stuck_in_requested2"></a>

If you have a directory that has been in the "Requested" state for more than five minutes, try deleting the directory and recreating it\. If this problem persists, contact the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/)\.

## I receive an "AZ Constrained" error when I create a directory<a name="contrained_az2"></a>

Some AWS accounts created before 2012 might have access to Availability Zones in the US East \(N\. Virginia\), US West \(N\. California\), or Asia Pacific \(Tokyo\) Region that do not support AWS Directory Service directories\. If you receive an error such as this when creating a directory, choose a subnet in a different Availability Zone and try to create the directory again\.

## Some of my users cannot authenticate with my directory<a name="kerberos_preauth2"></a>

Your user accounts must have Kerberos preauthentication enabled\. This is the default setting for new user accounts, but it should not be modified\. For more information about this setting, go to [Preauthentication](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc961961.aspx) on Microsoft TechNet\.

## I receive an "Invalid Credentials" error when the service account used by AD Connector attempts to authenticate<a name="invalid_creds"></a>

This can occur if the hard drive on your domain controller runs out of space\. Ensure that your domain controller's hard drives are not full\.
