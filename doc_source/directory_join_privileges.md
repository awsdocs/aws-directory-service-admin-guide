# Delegate directory join privileges for AWS Managed Microsoft AD<a name="directory_join_privileges"></a>

To join a computer to your directory, you need an account that has privileges to join computers to the directory\. 

With AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory, members of the **Admins** and **AWS Delegated Server Administrators** groups have these privileges\.

However, as a best practice, you should use an account that has only the minimum privileges necessary\. The following procedure demonstrates how to create a new group called `Joiners` and delegate the privileges to this group that are needed to join computers to the directory\.

You must perform this procedure on a computer that is joined to your directory and has the **Active Directory User and Computers** MMC snap\-in installed\. You must also be logged in as a domain administrator\.

**To delegate join privileges for AWS Managed Microsoft AD**

1. Open **Active Directory User and Computers** and select the organizational unit \(OU\) that has your NetBIOS name in the navigation tree, then select the **Users** OU\.
**Important**  
When you launch a AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory, AWS creates an organizational unit \(OU\) that contains all your directoryâ€™s objects\. This OU, which has the NetBIOS name that you typed when you created your directory, is located in the domain root\. The domain root is owned and managed by AWS\. You cannot make changes to the domain root itself, therefore, you must create the **Joiners** group within the OU that has your NetBIOS name\.

1. Open the context menu \(right\-click\) for **Users**, choose **New**, and then choose **Group**\. 

1. In the **New Object \- Group** box, type the following and choose **OK**\.
   + For **Group name**, type **Joiners**\.
   + For **Group scope**, choose **Global**\.
   + For **Group type**, choose **Security**\.

1. In the navigation tree, select the **Computers** container under your NetBIOS name\. From the **Action** menu, choose **Delegate Control**\.

1. On the **Delegation of Control Wizard** page, choose **Next**, and then choose **Add**\.

1. In the **Select Users, Computers, or Groups** box, type `Joiners` and choose **OK**\. If more than one object is found, select the `Joiners` group created above\. Choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Tasks to Delegate** page, select **Create a custom task to delegate**, and then choose **Next**\.

1. Select **Only the following objects in the folder**, and then select **Computer objects**\. 

1. Select **Create selected objects in this folder** and **Delete selected objects in this folder**\. Then choose **Next**\.

1. Verify the information on the **Completing the Delegation of Control Wizard** page and choose **Finish**\. 

1. Create a user with a strong password and add that user to the `Joiners` group\. This user must be in the **Users** container that is under your NetBIOS name\. The user will then have sufficient privileges to connect instances to the directory\.
