To create a new directory, perform the following steps\. Before starting this procedure, make sure you have completed the prerequisites identified in [Simple AD prerequisites](prereq_simple.md)\.

**To create a Simple AD directory**

1. In the [AWS Directory Service console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/directoryservicev2/) navigation pane, choose **Directories** and then choose **Set up directory**\.

1. On the **Select directory type** page, choose **Simple AD**, and then choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Enter directory information** page, provide the following information:  
**Directory size**  
Choose from either the **Small** or **Large** size option\. For more information about sizes, see [Simple Active Directory](directory_simple_ad.md)\.  
**Organization name**  
A unique organization name for your directory that will be used to register client devices\.  
This field is only available if you are creating your directory as part of launching Amazon WorkSpaces\.  
**Directory DNS name**  
The fully qualified name for the directory, such as `corp.example.com`\.  
**Directory NetBIOS name**  
The short name for the directory, such as `CORP`\.  
**Administrator password**  
The password for the directory administrator\. The directory creation process creates an administrator account with the user name `Administrator` and this password\.  
The directory administrator password is case\-sensitive and must be between 8 and 64 characters in length, inclusive\. It must also contain at least one character from three of the following four categories:  
   + Lowercase letters \(a\-z\)
   + Uppercase letters \(A\-Z\)
   + Numbers \(0\-9\)
   + Non\-alphanumeric characters \(\~\!@\#$%^&\*\_\-\+=`\|\\\(\)\{\}\[\]:;"'<>,\.?/\)  
**Confirm password**  
Retype the administrator password\.  
**Directory description**  
An optional description for the directory\.

1. On the **Choose VPC and subnets** page, provide the following information, and then choose **Next**\.  
**VPC**  
The VPC for the directory\.  
**Subnets**  
Choose the subnets for the domain controllers\. The two subnets must be in different Availability Zones\. 

1. On the **Review & create** page, review the directory information and make any necessary changes\. When the information is correct, choose **Create directory**\. It takes several minutes for the directory to be created\. Once created, the **Status** value changes to **Active**\.
