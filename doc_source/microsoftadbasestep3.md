# Step 3: Deploy an EC2 instance to manage your AWS Managed Microsoft AD<a name="microsoftadbasestep3"></a>

For this lab, we are using EC2 instances that have public IP addresses to make it easy to access the management instance from anywhere\. In a production setting, you can use instances that are in a private VPC that are only accessible through a VPN or Amazon Direct Connect link\. There is no requirement the instance have a public IP address\.

In this section, you walk through the various post\-deployment tasks necessary for client computers to connect to your domain using the Windows Server on your new EC2 instance\. You use the Windows Server in the next step to verify that the lab is operational\.

## Optional: Create a DHCP options set in AWS\-DS\-VPC01 for your directory<a name="createdhcpoptionsset"></a>

In this optional procedure, you set up a DHCP option scope so that EC2 instances in your VPC automatically use your AWS Managed Microsoft AD for DNS resolution\. For more information, see [DHCP options sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html)\.

**To create a DHCP options set for your directory**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **DHCP Options Sets**, and then choose **Create DHCP options set**\.

1. On the **Create DHCP options set** page, provide the following values for your directory:
   + For **Name**, type **AWS DS DHCP**\.
   + For **Domain name**, type **corp\.example\.com**\.
   + For **Domain name servers**, type the IP addresses of your AWS provided directory's DNS servers\. 
**Note**  
To find these addresses, go to the AWS Directory Service **Directories** page, and then choose the applicable directory ID, On the **Details** page, identify and use the IPs that are displayed in **DNS address**\.
   + Leave the settings blank for **NTP servers**, **NetBIOS name servers**, and **NetBIOS node type**\.

1. Choose **Create DHCP options set**, and then choose **Close**\. The new set of DHCP options appear in your list of DHCP options\.

1. Make a note of the ID of the new set of DHCP options \(**dopt\-*xxxxxxxx***\)\. You use it at the end of this procedure when you associate the new options set with your VPC\.
**Note**  
Seamless domain join works without having to configure a DHCP Options Set\. 

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Your VPCs**\.

1. In the list of VPCs, select **AWS DS VPC**, choose **Actions**, and then choose **Edit DHCP options set**\.

1. On the **Edit DHCP options set** page, select the options set that you recorded in Step 5, and then choose **Save**\.

## Create a role to join Windows instances to your AWS Managed Microsoft AD domain<a name="configureec2"></a>

Use this procedure to configure a role that joins an EC2 Windows instance to a domain\. For more information, see [Seamlessly join a Windows EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2-join-aws-domain.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows Instances*\.

**To configure EC2 to join Windows instances to your domain**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane of the IAM console, choose **Roles**, and then choose **Create role**\.

1. Under **Select type of trusted entity**, choose **AWS service**\.

1. Immediately under **Choose the service that will use this role**, choose **EC2**, and then choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. On the **Attached permissions policy** page, do the following:
   + Select the box next to the **AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore** managed policy\. This policy provides the minimum permissions necessary to use the Systems Manager service\.
   + Select the box next to **AmazonSSMDirectoryServiceAccess** managed policy\. The policy provides the permissions to join instances to an Active Directory managed by AWS Directory Service\.

   For information about these managed policies and other policies you can attach to an IAM instance profile for Systems Manager, see [Create an IAM instance profile for Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/setup-instance-profile.html) in the *AWS Systems Manager User Guide*\. For information about managed policies, see [AWS Managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

1. Choose **Next: Tags**\.

1. \(Optional\) Add one or more tag key\-value pairs to organize, track, or control access for this role, and then choose **Next: Review**\. 

1. For **Role name**, enter a name for the role that describes that it is used to join instances to a domain, such as **EC2DomainJoin**\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Role description**, enter a description\.

1. Choose **Create role**\. The system returns you to the **Roles** page\.

## Create an EC2 instance and automatically join the directory<a name="deployec2instance"></a>

In this procedure you set up a Windows Server system in Amazon EC2 that can be used later to administer users, groups, and policies in Active Directory\. 

**To create an EC2 instance and automatically join the directory**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. Choose **Launch Instance**\.

1. On the **Step 1** page, next to **Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Base \- ami\-*xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx*** choose **Select**\.

1. On the **Step 2** page, select **t3\.micro** \(note, you can choose a larger instance type\), and then choose **Next: Configure Instance Details**\.

1. On the **Step 3** page, do the following:
   + For **Network**, choose the VPC that ends with **AWS\-DS\-VPC01** \(for example, **vpc\-*xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx* \| AWS\-DS\-VPC01**\)\.
   + For **Subnet** choose **Public subnet 1**, which should be preconfigured for your preferred Availability Zone \(for example, **subnet\-*xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx* \| AWS\-DS\-VPC01\-Subnet01 \| *us\-west\-2a***\)\. 
   + For **Auto\-assign Public IP**, choose **Enable** \(if the subnet setting is not set to enable by default\)\.
   + For **Domain join directory**, choose **corp\.example\.com \(d\-*xxxxxxxxxx*\)**\.
   + For **IAM role** choose the name you gave your instance role in [Create a role to join Windows instances to your AWS Managed Microsoft AD domain](#configureec2), such as **EC2DomainJoin**\.
   + Leave the rest of the settings at their defaults\.
   + Choose **Next: Add Storage**\.

1. On the **Step 4** page, leave the default settings, and then choose **Next: Add Tags**\.

1. On the **Step 5** page, choose **Add Tag**\. Under **Key** type **corp\.example\.com\-mgmt** and then choose **Next: Configure Security Group**\.
