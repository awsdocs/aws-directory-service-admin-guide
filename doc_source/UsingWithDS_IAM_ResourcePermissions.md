# AWS Directory Service API permissions: Actions, resources, and conditions reference<a name="UsingWithDS_IAM_ResourcePermissions"></a>

When you are setting up [Access control](iam_auth_access.md#access_control) and writing permissions policies that you can attach to an IAM identity \(identity\-based policies\), you can use the following table as a reference\. The the following:
+ Each AWS Directory Service API operation
+ The corresponding actions for which you can grant permissions to perform the action
+ The AWS resource for which you can grant the permissions

 You specify the actions in the policy's `Action` field and the resource value in the policy's `Resource` field\. 

**Note**  
Some AWS applications may require use of nonpublic AWS Directory Service API operations such as `ds:AuthorizeApplication`, `ds:CheckAlias`, `ds:CreateIdentityPoolDirectory`, and `ds:UnauthorizeApplication` in their policies\.

You can use AWS global condition keys in your AWS Directory Service policies to express conditions\. For a complete list of AWS keys, see [Available Global Condition Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#AvailableKeys) in the *IAM User Guide*\. 

**Note**  
To specify an action, use the `ds:` prefix followed by the API operation name \(for example, `ds:CreateDirectory`\)\.
