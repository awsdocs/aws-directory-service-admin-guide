# Add a replicated Region<a name="multi-region-add-region"></a>

When you add a Region using the [Multi\-Region replication](ms_ad_configure_multi_region_replication.md) feature, AWS Managed Microsoft AD creates two domain controllers in the selected AWS Region, Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\), and subnet\. AWS Managed Microsoft AD also creates the related security groups that enable Windows workloads to connect to your directory in the new Region\. It also creates these resources using the same AWS account where your directory is already deployed\. You do this by choosing the Region, specifying the VPC, and providing the configurations for the new Region\.

Multi\-Region replication is only supported for the **Enterprise Edition** of AWS Managed Microsoft AD\.

## Prerequisites<a name="multi-region-add-region-prereqs"></a>

Before you proceed with the steps to add a new replication Region, we recommend that you first review the following prerequisite tasks\.
+ Verify that you have the necessary AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) permissions, Amazon VPC setup, and the subnet setup in the new Region to which you want to replicate the directory\.
+ If you want to use your existing on\-premises Active Directory credentials to access and manage AD\-aware workloads in AWS, you must create an AD trust between AWS Managed Microsoft AD and your on\-premises AD infrastructure\. For more information about trusts, see [Connect to your existing AD infrastructure](ms_ad_connect_existing_infrastructure.md)\.

## Add a Region<a name="multi-region-add-region-add"></a>

Use the following procedure to add a replicated Region for your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory\.

**To add a replicated Region**

1. In the [AWS Directory Service console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/directoryservicev2/) navigation pane, choose **Directories**\.

1. On the **Directories** page, choose your directory ID\.

1. On the **Directory details** page, under **Multi\-Region replication**, choose the **Primary** Region from the list, and then choose **Add Region**\.
**Note**  
You can only add Regions while the **Primary** Region is selected\. For more information, see [Primary Region](multi-region-global-primary-additional.md#multi-region-primary)\.

1. On the **Add Region** page, under **Region**, choose the Region you want to add from the list\.

1. Under **VPC**, choose the VPC to use for this Region\.
**Note**  
This VPC must not have a Classless Inter\-Domain Routing \(CIDR\) that overlaps with a VPC used by this directory in another Region\.

1. Under **Subnets**, choose the subnet to use for this Region\.

1. Review the information under **Pricing**, and then choose **Add**\.

1. When AWS Managed Microsoft AD completes the domain controller deployment process, the Region will display **Active** status\. You can now make updates to this Region as needed\.

## Next steps<a name="multi-region-add-region-next-steps"></a>

After you add your new Region, you should consider doing the following next steps:
+ Deploy additional domain controllers \(up to 20\) to your new Region as needed\. The number of domain controllers when you add a new Region is 2 by default, which is the minimum required for fault\-tolerance and high availability purposes\. For more information, see [Add or remove additional domain controllers](ms_ad_deploy_additional_dcs.md#addremovedcs)\.
+ Share your directory with more AWS accounts per Region\. Directory sharing configurations are not replicated from the primary Region automatically\. For more information, see [Share your directory](ms_ad_directory_sharing.md)\.
+ Enable log forwarding to retrieve your directoryâ€™s security logs using Amazon CloudWatch Logs from the new Region\. When you enable log forwarding, you must provide a log group name in each Region where you replicated your directory\. For more information, see [Enable log forwarding](ms_ad_enable_log_forwarding.md)\.
+ Enable Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) monitoring for the new Region to track your directory health status per Region\. For more information, see [Configure directory status notifications](ms_ad_enable_notifications.md)\.
