# What Gets Created<a name="create_details_ad_connector"></a>

When you create an AD Connector, AWS Directory Service automatically creates and associates an elastic network interface \(ENI\) with each of your domain controllers\. Each of these ENIs are essential for connectivity between your VPC and AWS Directory Service domain controllers and should never be deleted\. You can identify all network interfaces reserved for use with AWS Directory Service by the description: "AWS created network interface for directory *directory\-id*"\. For more information, see [Elastic Network Interfaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows Instances\.
