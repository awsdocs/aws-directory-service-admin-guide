# Tutorial: Creating a trust from AWS Managed Microsoft AD to a self\-managed Active Directory installation on Amazon EC2<a name="ms_ad_tutorial_test_lab_trust"></a>

In this tutorial, you learn how to create a trust between the AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory forest that you created in the [Base tutorial](ms_ad_tutorial_test_lab_base.md)\. You also learn to create a new native Active Directory forest on a Windows Server in Amazon EC2\. As shown in the following illustration, the lab that you create from this tutorial is the second building block necessary when setting up a complete AWS Managed Microsoft AD test lab\. You can use the test lab to test your pure cloud or hybrid cloudâ€“based AWS solutions\. 

You should only need to create this tutorial once\. After that you can add optional tutorials when necessary for more experience\.

**[Step 1: Set up your environment for trusts](microsoftadtruststep1.md)**  
Before you can establish trusts between a new Active Directory forest and the AWS Managed Microsoft AD forest that you created in the [Base tutorial](ms_ad_tutorial_test_lab_base.md), you need to prepare your Amazon EC2 environment\. To do that, you first create a Windows Server 2019 server, promote that server to a domain controller, and then configure your VPC accordingly\.

**[Step 2: Create the trusts](microsoftadtruststep2.md)**  
In this step, you create a two\-way forest trust relationship between your newly created Active Directory forest hosted in Amazon EC2 and your AWS Managed Microsoft AD forest in AWS\. 

**[Step 3: Verify the trust](microsoftadtruststep3.md)**  
Finally, as an administrator, you use the AWS Directory Service console to verify that the new trusts are operational\.
