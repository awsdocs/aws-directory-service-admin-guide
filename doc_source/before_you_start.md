# Prerequisites<a name="before_you_start"></a>

This tutorial assumes you already have the following:

**Note**  
AWS Managed Microsoft AD does not support trust with [Single label domains](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2269810/microsoft-support-for-single-label-domains)\.
+ An AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory created on AWS\. If you need help doing this, see [Getting started with AWS Managed Microsoft AD](ms_ad_getting_started.md)\.
+ An EC2 instance running Windows added to that AWS Managed Microsoft AD\. If you need help doing this, see [Manually join a Windows instance](join_windows_instance.md)\.
**Important**  
The admin account for your AWS Managed Microsoft AD must have administrative access to this instance\.
+ The following Windows Server tools installed on that instance:
  + AD DS and AD LDS Tools
  + DNS

  If you need help doing this, see [Installing the Active Directory administration tools](ms_ad_install_ad_tools.md)\.
+ A self\-managed \(on\-premises\) Microsoft Active Directory

  You must have administrative access to this directory\. The same Windows Server tools as listed above must also be available for this directory\.
+ An active connection between your self\-managed network and the VPC containing your AWS Managed Microsoft AD\. If you need help doing this, see [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud Connectivity Options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-vpc-connectivity-options/aws-vpc-connectivity-options.pdf)\.
+ A correctly set local security policy\. CheckÂ `Local Security Policy > Local Policies > Security Options > Network access: Named Pipes that can be accessed anonymously` and ensure that it contains at least the following three named pipes: 
  + netlogon
  + samr
  + lsarpc

## Tutorial configuration<a name="tutorial_config"></a>

For this tutorial, we've already created a AWS Managed Microsoft AD and a self\-managed domain\. The self\-managed network is connected to the AWS Managed Microsoft AD's VPC\. Following are the properties of the two directories:

### AWS Managed Microsoft AD running on AWS<a name="mad_domain"></a>
+ Domain name \(FQDN\): MyManagedAD\.example\.com
+ NetBIOS name: MyManagedAD
+ DNS Addresses: 10\.0\.10\.246, 10\.0\.20\.121
+ VPC CIDR: 10\.0\.0\.0/16

The AWS Managed Microsoft AD resides in VPC ID: vpc\-12345678\.

### Self\-managed or AWS Managed Microsoft AD domain<a name="onprem_domain"></a>
+ Domain name \(FQDN\): corp\.example\.com
+ NetBIOS name: CORP
+ DNS Addresses: 172\.16\.10\.153
+ Self\-managed CIDR: 172\.16\.0\.0/16
