# Cross\-service confused deputy prevention<a name="cross-service-confused-deputy-prevention"></a>

The confused deputy problem is a security issue where an entity that doesn't have permission to perform an action can coerce a more\-privileged entity to perform the action\. In AWS, cross\-service impersonation can result in the confused deputy problem\. Cross\-service impersonation can occur when one service \(the *calling service*\) calls another service \(the *called service*\)\. The calling service can be manipulated to use its permissions to act on another customer's resources in a way it should not otherwise have permission to access\. To prevent this, AWS provides tools that help you protect your data for all services with service principals that have been given access to resources in your account\. 

We recommend using the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourcearn](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourcearn) and [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourceaccount](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourceaccount) global condition context keys in resource policies to limit the permissions that AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory gives another service to the resource\. If the `aws:SourceArn` value does not contain the account ID, such as an Amazon S3 bucket ARN, you must use both global condition context keys to limit permissions\. If you use both global condition context keys and the `aws:SourceArn` value contains the account ID, the `aws:SourceAccount` value and the account in the `aws:SourceArn` value must use the same account ID when used in the same policy statement\. Use `aws:SourceArn` if you want only one resource to be associated with the cross\-service access\. Use `aws:SourceAccount` if you want to allow any resource in that account to be associated with the cross\-service use\.

The value of `aws:SourceArn` must be `arn:aws:logs:YOUR_REGION:YOUR_ACCOUNT_NUMBER:log-group:/aws/directoryservice/*`\.

The most effective way to protect against the confused deputy problem is to use the `aws:SourceArn` global condition context key with the full ARN of the resource\. If you don't know the full ARN of the resource or if you are specifying multiple resources, use the `aws:SourceArn` global context condition key with wildcards \(`*`\) for the unknown portions of the ARN\. For example, `arn:aws:servicename:*:123456789012:*`\. 

The following example shows how you can use the `aws:SourceArn` and `aws:SourceAccount` global condition context keys in AWS Managed Microsoft AD to prevent the confused deputy problem\.
