# Use Case 6: Share your directory to seamlessly join Amazon EC2 instances to a domain across AWS accounts<a name="usecase6"></a>

Sharing your directory across multiple AWS accounts enables you to manage AWS services such as [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) easily without the need to operate a directory for each account and each VPC\. You can use your directory from any AWS account and from any [Amazon VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) within an AWS Region\. This capability makes it easier and more cost effective to manage directory\-aware workloads with a single directory across accounts and VPCs\. For example, you can now manage your [Windows workloads](https://aws.amazon.com/windows/) deployed in EC2 instances across multiple accounts and VPCs easily by using a single AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory\. 

When you share your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory with another AWS account, you can use the Amazon EC2 console or [AWS Systems Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/) to seamlessly join your instances from any Amazon VPC within the account and AWS Region\. You can quickly deploy your directory\-aware workloads on EC2 instances by eliminating the need to manually join your instances to a domain or to deploy directories in each account and VPC\.
