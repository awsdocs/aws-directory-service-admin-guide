# Step 2: Create the trusts<a name="microsoftadtruststep2"></a>

In this section, you create two separate forest trusts\. One trust is created from the Active Directory domain on your EC2 instance and the other from your AWS Managed Microsoft AD in AWS\.

**To create the trust from your EC2 domain to your AWS Managed Microsoft AD**

1. Log into **example\.local**\.

1. Open **Server Manager** and in the console tree choose **DNS**\. Take note of the IPv4 address listed for the server\. You will need this in the next procedure when you create a conditional forwarder from **corp\.example\.com** to the **example\.local** directory\.

1. In the **Tools** menu, choose **Active Directory Domains and Trusts**\.

1. In the console tree, right\-click **example\.local** and then choose **Properties**\.

1. On the **Trusts** tab, choose **New Trust**, and then choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Trust Name** page, type **corp\.example\.com**, and then choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Trust Type** page, choose **Forest trust**, and then choose **Next**\.
**Note**  
AWS Managed Microsoft AD also supports external trusts\. However, for the purposes of this tutorial, you will create a two\-way forest trust\.

1. On the **Direction of Trust** page, choose **Two\-way**, and then choose **Next**\.
**Note**  
If you decide later to try this with a one\-way trust instead, ensure that the trust directions are setup correctly \(Outgoing on trusting domain, Incoming on trusted domain\)\. For general information, see [Understanding trust direction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc731404(v=ws.11)) on Microsoft's website\.

1. On the **Sides of Trust** page, choose **This domain only**, and then choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Outgoing Trust Authentication Level** page, choose **Forest\-wide authentication**, and then choose **Next**\.
**Note**  
Although **Selective authentication** in an option, for the simplicity of this tutorial we recommend that you do not enable it here\. When configured it restricts access over an external or forest trust to only those users in a trusted domain or forest who have been explicitly given authentication permissions to computer objects \(resource computers\) residing in the trusting domain or forest\. For more information, see [Configuring selective authentication settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc816580(v=ws.10))\.

1. On the **Trust Password** page, type the trust password twice, and then choose **Next**\. You will use this same password in the next procedure\.

1. On the **Trust Selections Complete** page, review the results, and then choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Trust Creation Complete** page, review the results, and then choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Confirm Outgoing Trust** page, choose **No, do not confirm the outgoing trust**\. Then choose **Next**

1. On the **Confirm Incoming Trust** page, choose **No, do not confirm the incoming trust**\. Then choose **Next**

1. On the **Completing the New Trust Wizard** page, choose **Finish**\.

**Note**  
Trust relationships is a global feature of AWS Managed Microsoft AD\. If you are using [Multi\-Region replication](ms_ad_configure_multi_region_replication.md), the following procedures must be performed in the [Primary Region](multi-region-global-primary-additional.md#multi-region-primary)\. The changes will be applied across all replicated Regions automatically\. For more information, see [Global vs Regional features](multi-region-global-region-features.md)\.

**To create the trust from your AWS Managed Microsoft AD to your EC2 domain**

1. Open the AWS Directory Service console\.

1. Choose the **corp\.example\.com** directory\.

1. On the **Directory details** page, do one of the following:
   + If you have multiple Regions showing under **Multi\-Region replication**, select the primary Region, and then choose the **Networking & security** tab\. For more information, see [Primary vs additional Regions](multi-region-global-primary-additional.md)\.
   + If you do not have any Regions showing under **Multi\-Region replication**, choose the **Networking & security** tab\.

1. In the **Trust relationships** section, choose **Actions**, and then select **Add trust relationship**\.

1. In the **Add a trust relationship** dialog box, do the following:
   + Under **Trust type** select **Forest trust**\.
**Note**  
Make sure that the **Trust type** you choose here matches the same trust type configured in the previous procedure \(To create the trust from your EC2 domain to your AWS Managed Microsoft AD\)\.
   + For **Existing or new remote domain name**, type **example\.local**\.
   + For **Trust password**, type the same password that you provided in the previous procedure\.
   + Under **Trust direction**, select **Two\-Way**\.
**Note**  
If you decide later to try this with a one\-way trust instead, ensure that the trust directions are setup correctly \(Outgoing on trusting domain, Incoming on trusted domain\)\. For general information, see [Understanding trust direction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc731404(v=ws.11)) on Microsoft's website\.
Although **Selective authentication** in an option, for the simplicity of this tutorial we recommend that you do not enable it here\. When configured it restricts access over an external or forest trust to only those users in a trusted domain or forest who have been explicitly given authentication permissions to computer objects \(resource computers\) residing in the trusting domain or forest\. For more information, see [Configuring selective authentication settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc816580(v=ws.10))\.
   + For **Conditional forwarder**, type the IP address of your DNS server in the **example\.local** forest \(which you noted in the previous procedure\)\. 
**Note**  
A conditional forwarder is a DNS server on a network that is used to forward DNS queries according to the DNS domain name in the query\. For example, a DNS server can be configured to forward all the queries it receives for names ending with widgets\.example\.com to the IP address of a specific DNS server or to the IP addresses of multiple DNS servers\.

1. Choose **Add**\.
