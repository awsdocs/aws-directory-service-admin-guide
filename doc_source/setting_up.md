# Setting up AWS Directory Service<a name="setting_up"></a>

To work with AWS Directory Service, you need to meet the prerequisites for AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory, AD Connector, or Simple AD\. For more information, see [AWS Managed Microsoft AD prerequisites](ms_ad_getting_started_prereqs.md), [AD Connector prerequisites](prereq_connector.md), or [Simple AD prerequisites](prereq_simple.md)\.

If you haven't already done so, you'll also need to create an AWS account and use the AWS Identity and Access Management service to control access\.
