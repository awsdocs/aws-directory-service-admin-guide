# Custom Schemas<a name="customschematopic"></a>

The first step in creating a custom schema is to define exactly what fields you must index\. These required fields form your schema's skeleton elements, to which you add your own fields\. Map the name and type of each field \(such as string, integer, Boolean\) to your object's structure\. You can define a schema with types and constraints and then apply them to a directory\. Once defined, Cloud Directory performs validation for attributes\.
