# Logging and monitoring in AWS Directory Service<a name="incident-response"></a>

As a best practice, monitor your organization to ensure that changes are logged\. This helps you to ensure that any unexpected change can be investigated and unwanted changes can be rolled back\. AWS Directory Service currently supports the following two AWS services so that you can monitor your organization and the activity that happens within it\.
+ Amazon CloudWatch \- You can use CloudWatch Events with the AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory type\. For more information, see [Enable log forwarding](ms_ad_enable_log_forwarding.md)\. Additionally, you can use CloudWatch Metrics to monitor domain controller performance\. For more information, see [Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to determine when to add domain controllers](ms_ad_deploy_additional_dcs.md#scaledcs)\. 
+ AWS CloudTrail \- You can use CloudTrail with all AWS Directory Service directory types\. For more information, see [Logging AWS Directory Service API calls with CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/devguide/cloudtrail_logging.html)\.
