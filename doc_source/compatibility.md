# Browser compatibility<a name="compatibility"></a>

AWS applications and services such as WorkSpaces, Amazon WorkMail, Amazon Connect, Amazon Chime, Amazon WorkDocs, and AWS Single Sign\-On \(AWS SSO\) all require valid sign\-in credentials from a compatible browser before you can access them\. The following table describes only the browsers and browser versions that are compatible for sign\-ins\.

Now that you’ve verified you are using a supported version of your browser, we recommend that you also review the section below to verify your browser has been configured to use the Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) setting required by AWS\.

## What is TLS?<a name="whattls"></a>

TLS is a protocol web browsers and other applications use to exchange data securely over a network\. TLS ensures that a connection to a remote endpoint is the intended endpoint through encryption and endpoint identity verification\. The versions of TLS, to date, are TLS 1\.0, 1\.1, 1\.2 and 1\.3\.

## Which TLS versions are supported by AWS SSO<a name="whichtls"></a>

AWS applications and services support TLS 1\.1, 1\.2 and 1\.3 for secure sign\-ins\. As of October 30th 2019, TLS 1\.0 is no longer supported so it is important that all browsers are configured to support TLS 1\.1 or above\. This means, you will not be able to sign\-in to AWS applications and services if you access them while TLS 1\.0 is enabled\. For assistance making this change, contact your admin\. 

## How do I enable supported TLS versions in my browser<a name="howtls"></a>

It depends on your browser\. Usually you can find this setting under the advanced settings area in your browser settings\. For example, in Internet Explorer you’ll find various TLS options under **Internet Properties**, the **Advanced** tab, and then under the **Security** section\. Check your browser manufacturers Help web site for specific instructions\.
