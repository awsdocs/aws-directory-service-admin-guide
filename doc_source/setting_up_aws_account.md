# Sign up for an AWS account<a name="setting_up_aws_account"></a>

Your AWS account gives you access to all services, but you are charged only for the resources that you use\.

If you do not have an AWS account, complete the following steps to create one\.

**To sign up for an AWS account**

1. Open [https://portal\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/signup](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup)\.

1. Follow the online instructions\.

   Part of the sign\-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad\.

   When you sign up for an AWS account, an *AWS account root user* is created\. The root user has access to all AWS services and resources in the account\. As a security best practice, [assign administrative access to an administrative user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html), and use only the root user to perform [tasks that require root user access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html)\.

Your root account credentials identify you to services in AWS and grant you unlimited use of your AWS resources, such as your Amazon WorkSpaces\. To allow other users to manage AWS Directory Service resources without sharing your security credentials, use AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)\. We recommend that everyone work as an IAM user, even the account owner\. You should create an IAM user for yourself, give that IAM user administrative privileges, and use it for all your work\.
