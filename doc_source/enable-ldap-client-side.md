# Enable client\-side LDAPS<a name="enable-ldap-client-side"></a>

To enable client\-side LDAPS, you import your certificate authority \(CA\) certificate into AD Connector, and then enable LDAPS on your directory\. Upon enabling, all LDAP traffic between AWS applications and your self\-managed Active Directory will flow with Secure Sockets Layer \(SSL\) channel encryption\.

You can use two different methods to enable client\-side LDAPS for your directory\. You can use either the AWS Management Console method or the AWS CLI method\.

## Step 1: Register certificate in AWS Directory Service<a name="step1-register-cert-ldap-client-side"></a>

Use either of the following methods to register a certificate in AWS Directory Service\.

**Method 1: To register your certificate in AWS Directory Service \(AWS Management Console\)**

1. In the [AWS Directory Service console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/directoryservicev2/) navigation pane, select **Directories**\.

  ```
  aws ds list-certificates --directory-id your_directory_id
  ```

## Step 3: Enable client\-side LDAPS<a name="step3-enable-ldap-client-side"></a>

Use either of the following methods to enable client\-side LDAPS in AWS Directory Service\.

**Note**

  ```

## Step 4: Check LDAPS status<a name="step4-check-status-ldap-client-side"></a>

Use either of the following methods to check the LDAPS status in AWS Directory Service\.

**Method 1: To check LDAPS status in AWS Directory Service \(AWS Management Console\)**

1. Go to the **Client\-side LDAPS** section on the **Directory details** page\.

1. If the status value is displayed as **Enabled**, LDAPS has been successfully configured\.

**Method 2: To check LDAPS status in AWS Directory Service \(AWS CLI\)**
