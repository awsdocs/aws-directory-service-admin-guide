# Manually join a Linux instance<a name="join_linux_instance"></a>

In addition to Amazon EC2 Windows instances, you can also join certain Amazon EC2 Linux instances to your AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory directory\. The following Linux instance distributions and versions are supported:
+ Amazon Linux AMI 2018\.03\.0
+ Amazon Linux 2 \(64\-bit x86\)
+ Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 \(HVM\) \(64\-bit x86\)
+ Ubuntu Server 18\.04 LTS & Ubuntu Server 16\.04 LTS
+ CentOS 7 x86\-64
+ SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1

**Note**  
Other Linux distributions and versions may work but have not been tested\.

## Join an instance to your directory<a name="join_linux_prereq"></a>

Before you can join either an Amazon Linux, CentOS, Red Hat, or Ubuntu instance to your directory, the instance must first be launched as specified in [Seamlessly join a Windows EC2 instance](launching_instance.md)\. 

**Important**  
Some of the following procedures, if not performed correctly, can render your instance unreachable or unusable\. Therefore, we strongly suggest you make a backup or take a snapshot of your instance before performing these procedures\.

**To join a linux instance to your directory**  
Follow the steps for your specific Linux instance using one of the following tabs:

------
#### [ Amazon Linux ]<a name="amazonlinux"></a>

1. Connect to the instance using any SSH client\.

1. Configure the Linux instance to use the DNS server IP addresses of the AWS Directory Service\-provided DNS servers\. You can do this either by setting it up in the DHCP Options set attached to the VPC or by setting it manually on the instance\. If you want to set it manually, see [How do I assign a static DNS server to a private Amazon EC2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-static-dns-ubuntu-debian/) in the AWS Knowledge Center for guidance on setting the persistent DNS server for your particular Linux distribution and version\.

1. Make sure your Amazon Linux \- 64bit instance is up to date\.

   ```
   sudo yum -y update
   ```

1. Install the required Amazon Linux packages on your Linux instance\.
**Note**  
Some of these packages may already be installed\.   
As you install the packages, you might be presented with several pop\-up configuration screens\. You can generally leave the fields in these screens blank\.  
Amazon Linux 1  

   ```
   sudo yum -y install sssd realmd krb5-workstation
   ```  
Amazon Linux 2  

   ```
   sudo yum -y install sssd realmd krb5-workstation samba-common-tools
   ```
**Note**  
For help with determining the Amazon Linux version you are using, see [Identifying Amazon Linux images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/amazon-linux-ami-basics.html#amazon-linux-image-id) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

   ```
   sudo realm join -U join_account@example.com example.com --verbose
   ```  
*join\_account@example\.com*  
An account in the *example\.com* domain that has domain join privileges\. Enter the password for the account when prompted\. For more information about delegating these privileges, see [Delegate directory join privileges for AWS Managed Microsoft AD](directory_join_privileges.md)\.  
*example\.com*  
The fully qualified DNS name of your directory\.

   ```
   ...
    * Successfully enrolled machine in realm
   ```

1. Set the SSH service to allow password authentication\.

   1. Open the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file in a text editor\.

      ```
      sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
      ```

   1. Set the `PasswordAuthentication` setting to `yes`\.

      ```
      PasswordAuthentication yes
      ```

   1. Restart the SSH service\.

      ```
      sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
      ```

      Alternatively:

      ```
      sudo service sshd restart
      ```

1. After the instance has restarted, connect to it with any SSH client and add the AWS Delegated Administrators group to the sudoers list by performing the following steps:

   1. Open the `sudoers` file with the following command:

      ```
      sudo visudo
      ```

   1. Add the following to the bottom of the `sudoers` file and save it\.

      ```
      ## Add the "AWS Delegated Administrators" group from the example.com domain.
      %AWS\ Delegated\ Administrators@example.com ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

#### [ Ubuntu ]<a name="ubuntu"></a>

1. Connect to the instance using any SSH client\.

1. Configure the Linux instance to use the DNS server IP addresses of the AWS Directory Service\-provided DNS servers\. You can do this either by setting it up in the DHCP Options set attached to the VPC or by setting it manually on the instance\. If you want to set it manually, see [How do I assign a static DNS server to a private Amazon EC2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-static-dns-ubuntu-debian/) in the AWS Knowledge Center for guidance on setting the persistent DNS server for your particular Linux distribution and version\.

1. Make sure your Ubuntu \- 64bit instance is up to date\.

   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get -y upgrade
   ```

1. Install the required Ubuntu packages on your Linux instance\.

   ```
   sudo apt-get -y install sssd realmd krb5-user samba-common packagekit adcli
   ```

1. Disable Reverse DNS resolution and set the default realm to your domain's FQDN\. Ubuntu Instances **must** be reverse\-resolvable in DNS before the realm will work\. Otherwise, you have to disable reverse DNS in /etc/krb5\.conf as follows:

   ```
   sudo vi /etc/krb5.conf
   ```

   ```
   [libdefaults] 
   default_realm = EXAMPLE.COM 
   rdns = false
   ```

1. Join the instance to the directory with the following command\. 

   ```
   sudo realm join -U join_account example.com --verbose
   ```  
*join\_account@example\.com*  
The **sAMAccountName** for an account in the *example\.com* domain that has domain join privileges\. Enter the password for the account when prompted\. For more information about delegating these privileges, see [Delegate directory join privileges for AWS Managed Microsoft AD](directory_join_privileges.md)\.  
*example\.com*  
The fully qualified DNS name of your directory\.

   ```
   ...
    * Successfully enrolled machine in realm
   ```

1. Set the SSH service to allow password authentication\.

   1. Open the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file in a text editor\.

      ```

      ```

1. After the instance has restarted, connect to it with any SSH client and add the AWS Delegated Administrators group to the sudoers list by performing the following steps:

   1. Open the `sudoers` file with the following command:

      ```
      sudo visudo
      ```

   1. Add the following to the bottom of the `sudoers` file and save it\.

      ```
      ## Add the "AWS Delegated Administrators" group from the example.com domain.
      %AWS\ Delegated\ Administrators@example.com ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
      ```

      \(The above example uses "\\<space>" to create the Linux space character\.\)

## Restricting account login access<a name="linux_filter"></a>

Since all accounts are defined in Active Directory, by default, all the users in the directory can log in to the instance\. You can allow only specific users to log in to the instance with ad\_access\_filter in sssd\.conf\. For example:

```
ad_access_filter = (memberOf=cn=admins,ou=Testou,dc=example,dc=com)
```

*memberOf*  
Indicates that users should only be allowed access to the instance if they are a member of a specific group\.

*cn*  
The common name of the group that should have access\. In this example, the group name is *admins*\.

*ou*  
This is the organizational unit in which the above group is located\. In this example, the OU is *Testou*\.

*dc*  
This is the domain component of your domain\. In this example, *example*\.

*dc*  
This is an additional domain component\. In this example, *com*\.

You must manually add ad\_access\_filter to your /etc/sssd/sssd\.conf\.

Open the /etc/sssd/sssd\.conf file in a text editor\.

```
sudo vi /etc/sssd/sssd.conf
```

After you do this, your sssd\.conf might look like this:

```
[sssd]
domains = example.com
config_file_version = 2 
services = nss, pam 

[domain/example.com] 
ad_domain = example.com 
krb5_realm = EXAMPLE.COM 
realmd_tags = manages-system joined-with-samba 
cache_credentials = True 
id_provider = ad 
krb5_store_password_if_offline = True 
default_shell = /bin/bash 
ldap_id_mapping = True 
use_fully_qualified_names = True 
fallback_homedir = /home/%u@%d 
access_provider = ad 
ad_access_filter = (memberOf=cn=admins,ou=Testou,dc=example,dc=com)
```

In order for the configuration to take effect, you need to restart the sssd service:

```
sudo systemctl restart sssd.service
```

Alternatively, you could use:

```
sudo service sssd restart
```

## Connect to the instance<a name="linux_connect"></a>

When a user connects to the instance using an SSH client, they are prompted for their user name\. The user can enter the user name in either the `username@example.com` or `EXAMPLE\username` format\. The response will appear similar to the following, depending on which linux distribution you are using:

**Amazon Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and CentOS Linux**
